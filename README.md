# Sarcasm-Detection-in-Hindi-Tweets

Sarcasm detection in Hindi tweets involves identifying and classifying tweets that express sarcasm, a form of verbal irony where the intended meaning is opposite to the literal meaning. Detecting sarcasm is particularly challenging in Hindi due to the nuanced use of language, cultural context, and informal writing style common on social media platforms. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT and HindiBERT for feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest for classification, we aim to develop a model that accurately distinguishes between sarcastic and non-sarcastic Hindi tweets.
